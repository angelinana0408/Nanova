Three different perspectives are also available now to show mass spectra (scans) and selected mass fragment view in nominal, accurate and exact modus.

It's now possible to show selected mass fragments in the "selected chromatogram ion view" by clicking on the mass fragment in the mass spectrum view. By clicking twice on it, it'll be removed.
